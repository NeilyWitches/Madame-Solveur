# Madame Solveur

If you like problem solving as much as I do, I think you're going to enjoy this game! Based on the series of games known as Professor Layton, [Mme Solvery](https://neilywitches.github.io/Madame-Solveur/) has you playing through a variety of fun but challenging puzzles. The entire project was done using Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation pushing its capabilities to the limit.
